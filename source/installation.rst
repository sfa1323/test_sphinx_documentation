Installation

 Sample text: A manual installation requires the user to download the software, save it on a computer, and run the application manually. This process is most likely going to be used by people who are using the computer at home, but it can also be used by employees who need to install software on computers that they don’t own. When employees need to install software on other people’s computers, they’ll need to make sure that they get permission first.

Once software has been installed, users will need to set up preferences and configure the program to meet their needs. If the user is installing a program for a company or school, they may need to talk to their manager or IT department to get help with these steps.

Displayed for everyone:
Once the program has been installed, there may be additional steps that the user needs to take in order to get started. For example, if the program is part of a suite of products, the user may need to run an update or set up an account with the vendor before they can start using the product.
Users should also make sure that they have all of the necessary hardware before installing a program. For example, if a program only works with a certain type of printer, then you’ll need to make sure that you have one of those printers before you install the software.
