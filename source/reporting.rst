Sample text: As part of your responsibility to ensure data integrity, you must report any errors to the appropriate parties. If it involves human error, you may need to report it to the person who made the mistake and apologize. If a computer system is involved, you should report the error to your IT department.

Displayed for everyone:
If the error is a serious one, you should report it to management immediately. In some cases, you may have an obligation to report errors to regulatory agencies and other third parties. For example, if you are a health care provider and you discover a data breach affecting patient data, you must report it to the appropriate authorities. In such cases, failing to report the error could result in legal consequences for both you and your organization.

When reporting errors, it is important to provide as much detail as possible. For example, if a customerâ€™s credit card information was compromised, you should provide the name of the customer, the amount of the transaction, the date of the transaction, and so on. Similarly, if a computer system is experiencing errors, you should provide details about when they started and what they are.
